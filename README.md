##Breast Tumor Detection Using Inception-ResNet-v2
Welcome to the repository for my Breast Tumor Detection project, an advanced machine learning solution designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing breast tumors using the powerful Inception-ResNet-v2 architecture.

#Project Overview
This project utilizes the Inception-ResNet-v2 model, tailored for high-precision image classification, to automatically detect breast tumors in ultrasound images. Achieving an impressive 98% accuracy, this model demonstrates significant potential in assisting medical professionals with early and accurate tumor detection.

#Dataset
The project uses the Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset (BUSI), available on Kaggle. This dataset includes labeled images categorized into normal, benign, and malignant classes, which are crucial for training our model. You can access the dataset here.
